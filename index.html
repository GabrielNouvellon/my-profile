      <p>I love guitar, skateboarding, basketball and I am very concerned about all the environmental issues. That's why I develloped ZIK'ECO, a website that help the climate to go better, using mode</p>

      <h2>Guitar🎸</h2>
        <p>Since I was a kid, I've always played guitar. It's something I love because it's fun and at the same time very stimulating for the ear skill, memory and hand skills.</p>

      <h2>Skateboard🛹</h2>
      <p>I love <strong>skateboard</strong>. In fact, it's a passion that I discovered during the lockdown and i truly love it. It allows me to surpass myself mentally and physically and brings me great joy when I succeed a trick</p>

      <h2>Basketball🏀</h2>
      <p>I also love to play basketball. I've been playing it in clubs since the beginning of my life but now that I'm in graduate school, I don't have the time.</p>

    <div class="box-design">
      <h2>Environment🌿</h2>
      <p>This strong desire to preserve nature comes from the fact that I spent most of my childhood in the countryside, where I spent my days in nature. When I was 13, I moved to Indonesia and was shocked by the lack of respect for the environment there. That's why I want to do something in that direction.</p>
